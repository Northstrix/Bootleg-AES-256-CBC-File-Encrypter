# glui
A simple menu library for OpenGL apps.

## Why glui?

Because it is very easy to use to prototype things. The library is header only! Just a few lines of code will get you a fully responsive and working menu!

## This uses my [2D library](https://github.com/meemknight/glui), check it out!
(but you can add that easily or make your own backed ðŸ‘€)
